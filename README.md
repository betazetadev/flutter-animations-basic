# 🎬 Flutter Animations Demo
A practical example showcasing three essential types of animations in Flutter:

✅ **Implicit Animations** – Automatically animate size, color, alignment, and opacity changes.  
✅ **Explicit Animations** – Manually control animations using `AnimationController`.  
✅ **Hero Animation** – Smooth transitions between screens using shared elements.

## 📸 Preview

## 🚀 Features
- Implementation of **implicit animations** (`AnimatedContainer`, `AnimatedOpacity`, `AnimatedAlign`, `AnimatedSwitcher`).
- Usage of **explicit animations** with `AnimationController`, `Tween`, `CurvedAnimation`, and `AnimatedBuilder`.
- **Hero Animation** for seamless transitions between screens.
- **Simple and intuitive UI** with a main screen allowing easy navigation between animation sections.
